        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
        <ul id="problem1">
            <li>Divergent: This is an effective scale given that it is balanced.
                This is necessary so that the progression from the light color in the middle
                to the darker colors on either side is the same in both directions. This ensures
                the scale has a "midpoint", is sequential on either sside, and that it is saturated on 
                the ends and neutral in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is not an effective scale given that the data has a definitive midpoint. This is 
                a sequential scale which will not easily convey the midpoint as "skyblue" which can be subjective
                much more so than a whiter color between two other more saturated hues. While this scale could be
                applied to this dataset, it may not be as useful as a divergent scale.
            </li>
            <li>
                TO BE COMPLETED
            </li>
            <li>
                I would recommend that they use a sequential scale of one single color to reate this choropleth map. 
                This is due to the fact that it will be easier to compare life expectancies accross the map when colors 
                are only lighter or darker than those around them for nearby areas. While this could also be done with this 
                rainbow scale, the colors are less meaningful when they are on the map -- they are not easy to compare given
                that their natural order is not as intuitive as a sequential scale would be in this scenario.
            </li>
        </ul>
